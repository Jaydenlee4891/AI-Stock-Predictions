# AI-Trading-Bot
This project aims to create an AI that will automatically trade stocks for you
This project is also gonna build an UI so it is easier to control. I will be testing maachine on an Alpaca Paper account and will share the results after 6 months and compare it to the major metrics like and SPY(S and P 500), QQQ(Nasdaq), and Dow Jones Index.

This project will also build a simple user interface using Tinker. 

You will need to have acess to chatGPT premium to have access the secret API key and you will also need an Alpaca account to access the alpaca secret key and key.

After you copy the key you can just copy into the code and you should have a working machine. For the chatGPT api key you need to scroll down a bit and find the gpt_response function
